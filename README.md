## Welcome to Odemy!

[Odemy](https://github-open-academy.github.io) is a server less open source learning platform hosted here at github pages using github repositories as content store.

## How do I add my content?

It's super easy to add your content be it a tutorial or a course for a particular topic. Odemy makes use of Git feature called **Fork** where users "copy" a specific repo to their own account.

> A _fork_ is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to
> freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
> [Reference](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

All forks of the [original repo/project](https://github.com/github-open-academy/fork-me) will then be listed in Odemy.

Here's how:

 1. Fork this [repo](https://github.com/github-open-academy/fork-me).
 2. Edit the repository name. Repo name will serve as the title of the curated content.
 3. Edit README.md. This file serves as content introduction. You can use online markdown editor like [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io).
 4. Edit playlist.json according to your course's playlist. For now, only Youtube videos are supported so please use video id as ytId.

## Help us improve the page
